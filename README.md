# Create-your-hero
This is a small app I created in order to use my basic knowledge on if statements. It will be improved and evolved over time. 

I made this app that when you write your prefered weapon or hero, it will display the appropriate preposition("a" or "an") before it so it would be gramatically correct. 

**I've done it like this: 

**"<input type="text" id="myHero" placeholder="Type of hero">" This is the input field
